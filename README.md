# find-number-palindrome

###### I watched a YouTube video recently: https://bit.ly/3HikIVU.

###### This video suggested that when you take any number, and added it with its reverse value (ie, 174 + 471), you would eventually find a palindrome. If the addition was not a palindrome, take that number and add it to its reverse value, until you reach a palindrome.

###### This seems to work for most numbers. Within 3/4 iterations, you'll find a palindrome. The example posed in the video went like this:

None (174 + 471 = 645)
None (645 + 546 = 1191)
None (1191 + 1911 = 3102)
PALINDROME FOUND! (3102 + 2013 = 5115)
